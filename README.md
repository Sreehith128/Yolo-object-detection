# Yolo-object-detection
Yolo object detection using opencv and pretrained YOLOv3

YOLO(You Only Look Once) algorithm is used to detect multiple objects on an image.We used pretrained weights and configuration file downloaded from [link](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) for Yolo detection.

Also download classes names(COCO Dataset text file) from same link.

We use openCv to apply yolo on our webcam output.Even you can apply on video by changing VideoCapture(0) to VideoCapture(path of video).

Have fun!
